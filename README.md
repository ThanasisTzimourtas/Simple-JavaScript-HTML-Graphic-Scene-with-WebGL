# Simple JavaScript Graphics scene with WebGL 
 
WebGL enables web content to use an API based on OpenGL ES 2.0 to perform 2D and 3D rendering in an HTML canvas in browsers that support it without the use of plug-ins.
WebGL programs consist of control code written in JavaScript and shader code (GLSL) that is executed on a computer's Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). WebGL elements can be mixed with other HTML elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background.
This project uses WebGL to represent a small interactive graphical scene created as part of a demonstration of WebGL capabilities.
